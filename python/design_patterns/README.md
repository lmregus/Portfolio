# Head First Design Patterns in Python

While learning Design Patterns from the Head First Design Patterns book. I decided that it would be good practice, to rewrite some examples in Python.

## Getting Started

Just clone the repo and go to each design pattern directory. In each of them you should find a file that runs the code using that specific pattern.
For exmaple in the strategy_pattern directory you can run
```
python duck_simulator.py
```

### Prerequisites

You must have Python3 in order to run these examples. In the design_patterns directory there's a virtual environment with Python 3.7.0, if you already have Python installed you can just do
```
source env/bin/activate
```

### Installing

If you don't have Python installed. Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Built With

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used

See also [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126). All the examples are based on the examples from the book.
