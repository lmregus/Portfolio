An Opportunity To Learn
	Four months ago, when I started taking the English Composition I course, I was very afraid. I am a foreigner, I come from Dominican Republic, so English is not my first language and sometimes is very hard for me to express what I think in English. Writing is an art that takes time to learn and improve, is not as easy to speak, imagine doing in another language, a language one can not handle very well.
	This is not my first English class though, the last semester I had to take Basic Writing, that is a remedial course for those who are not ready to start in English Composition I. I have to admit that taking that remedial course was very helpful, I learned very good strategies that helped when taking this class.
	I certainly have more weaknesses than strength when writing, but I did my best to overcome them and tried to get better. As I said before, English is not my first language, so when writing in English I have to pay attention to prepositions, word forms, misspelled words, and I have to be very careful with run-on sentences; and even though I tried, my brain is so used to think in Spanish that I made those mistakes without even knowing, no even when I proofread the material I can not noticed them. Another weakness I have while writing, is coming with a strong conclusion, I have found that for me, is one of the hardest part of writing.
	I have some strengths, or to describe it better, good strategies that I learned while taking Basic Writing. One of the strategies I really like, is doing prewriting because it helps me find many ideas regarding the topic I am writing. When I am doing the prewriting, I can visualize what I am going to talk about, question myself about the topic, and do free writing. Prewriting is an excellent way to make writing an essay a little bit easier, and more for those in my position.
	Before I started creating my final draft, I revised very carefully my previous drafts. First I focused myself on correcting the errors the professor found on my paper, and then revised the structure of my writing to make sure that it had a complete structure, such as an introduction, a strong and clear thesis statement, and enough coherent paragraphs to support my thesis. I also used to read my drafts aloud to myself, because is very helpful when trying to identify grammatical errors.
	I do not rely heavily on the comments of other students when doing peer review, sometimes is helpful, but most of the times is not because some students just do the peer review because the professor told them to, and some of them do not do a good job. I tend to heavily rely on the comments of my instructor, because I trust in her judgment and I know the she wants us all to learn, improve, and get better at writing.
	I really enjoyed taking English Composition I, because I  had become better at writing. What was most important for me, was the fact that I learned how to write a research paper and the steps that I have to take to write one. That was the first time ever in my life that I had to write a research paper and it was very interesting, because I learned about a very important topic that is recently resonating in the United States. Thanks to this class I even payed for a membership where I have access to journals and research papers focused in my area of interest, so I can become more familiar with that formal writing that I happened to like very much.
